# Tailwind v4

TailwindCSS v4 is now available! This guide will help you migrate your existing TailwindCSS v4 project to Choice UI.

---

## Migration Steps

1. Follow the official [Tailwind v4 upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta)
2. Upgrade Choice UI version

```bash
pnpm add @choice-ui/react@latest @choice-ui/design-tokens@latest
```

3. Configure Choice UI with the new Tailwind v4 syntax

### Update CSS Import

#### Without tailwind.config.js

Since Tailwind v4 favors a CSS-first approach, `tailwind.config.js` will not be required.

Add these imports to your main CSS file (e.g., `app.css` or `index.css`):

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@choice-ui/design-tokens/tokens.css";
@import "@choice-ui/design-tokens/preflight.css";
@import "@choice-ui/design-tokens/tailwind.css";
@source "../../../node_modules/@choice-ui/react";
```

**Important:** The `@source` directive is a powerful Tailwind CSS 4.0 feature that tells Tailwind where to scan for class names. This is essential to ensure styles from Choice UI components are properly recognized.

#### With tailwind.config.js

In Tailwind v4, `tailwind.config.js` is still supported for backward compatibility. If you still need to use it, you can load it explicitly as below:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@choice-ui/design-tokens/tokens.css";
@import "@choice-ui/design-tokens/preflight.css";
@import "@choice-ui/design-tokens/tailwind.css";
@config "./tailwind.config.js";
@source "../../../node_modules/@choice-ui/react";
```

### Update PostCSS Configuration

Key changes in TailwindCSS v4:

- `tailwindcss` was a PostCSS plugin in v3 and now it is in `@tailwindcss/postcss` package.
- `autoprefixer` is no longer required as prefixing is handled automatically.

Update your `postcss.config.mjs`:

```js
const config = {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
};

export default config;
```

### Update Vite Configuration (Vite Projects Only)

If you're using Vite, you can use the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin for better performance:

```bash
pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/vite
```

Then in your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tailwindcss()],
});
```

**Note:** If using the Vite plugin, you don't need `@tailwindcss/postcss` in your PostCSS configuration.

## Verification

After migration, verify that:

1. Your styles are being applied correctly
2. The build process completes without errors
3. Choice UI components render as expected

> Make sure to check the [Tailwind v4 documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta) for any breaking changes that might affect your existing styles.
